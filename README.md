### Time of Project: Fall 2019
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, my classmate and I examined cases of disease outbreaks in animals. We mined data to discover and visualize where, when, and what diseases affect different types of animals. We focused our analysis on Europe because this is where most cases where. For details, please see the [Animal Disease Presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/AnimalDiseaseAnalysis/raw/main/Animal%20Disease%20Presentation.pptx) and [Animal Disease Report](https://github.com/iscarff123/AnimalDiseaseAnalysis/blob/main/Animal%20Disease%20Report.pdf) files. Below are some example visualizations.
