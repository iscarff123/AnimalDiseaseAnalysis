# Animal Disease Analysis
### Time of Project: Fall 2019
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, my classmate and I examined cases of disease outbreaks in animals. We mined data to discover and visualize where, when, and what diseases affect different types of animals. For details, please see the [Animal Disease Presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/AnimalDiseaseAnalysis/raw/main/Animal%20Disease%20Presentation.pptx) and [Animal Disease Report](https://github.com/iscarff123/AnimalDiseaseAnalysis/blob/main/Animal%20Disease%20Report.pdf) files.
